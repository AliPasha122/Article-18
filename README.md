Domestic refrigeration units contribute significantly to household energy consumption.
Despite advances in compressor efficiency and insulation, energy demand remains high due
to temperature fluctuations and compressor cycling. This paper proposes a novel PCMassisted cooling system to stabilize internal temperatures, reduce compressor workload, and
lower energy consumption.
